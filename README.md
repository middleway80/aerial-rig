# Open Aerial Rig

**Warning** This is a work in progress.

The goal of this project is to produce a safe and secure indoor
"aerial rig" with the following goals:

  * Minimal cutting, drilling, and trigonometry
  * Parts are readily available at local home improvement stores or online
  * Can be disassembled and reassembled easily
  * Have an internal footprint of a 5'x8' rug
  * Have a minimum of 6 sq foot playspace in the middle

## Current design

![plan](frame-plan.jpg)

The current design uses the [Easy 1-2-3 A-Frame Swing Set Bracket](http://www.easternjunglegym.com/easy-a-frame-swing-set-bracket-301)

This bracket is not available at a local home improvement store but
makes construction extremely easy.
